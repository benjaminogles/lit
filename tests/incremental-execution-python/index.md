A Quick Introduction to Python
------------------------------

In this tutorial, I will introduce Python by writing a few short programs
and displaying their output.

Python has a very simple "Hello World" program.

```python
print("Hello World")
```
```plaintext
Hello World
```

Variables do not have to be declared with a type.
Their type can change at runtime.

```python
a = 100
print(a)
a = "Hello World"
print(a)
```
```plaintext
100
Hello World
```
