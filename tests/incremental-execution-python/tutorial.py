# A Quick Introduction to Python
# ------------------------------
# 
# In this tutorial, I will introduce Python by writing a few short programs
# and displaying their output.
#
# Python has a very simple "Hello World" program.
print("Hello World")

# lit execute
# lit text
#
# Variables do not have to be declared with a type.
# Their type can change at runtime.
a = 100
print(a)
a = "Hello World"
print(a)

# lit execute
