# Hello C

It is common to introduce people to a new programming language
by showing them how to print the words "Hello World" to standard
output. This program achieves that goal using the C programming
language.

First we need to include a header.

```
#include <stdio.h>

```

Then we define the main function which will be executed when the
program starts. It doesn't need to accept any arguments in this
case so we just write 'void'.

```
int main(void)
{
    // print to standard output in two ways
    fprintf(stdout, "Hello World\n");
    printf("Hello World\n");
}

```

Running the Program
-------------------

C programs must be compiled to instructions specific to your processor.

```
TODO build/run file with options: ''
```
